```

### 2. Update Database Configuration

Navigate to `config/database.yml` and update the database configurations (e.g., database name, username, password, etc.) based on your local setup.

### 3. Create the Database

Run the following command to create the database:

```bash
rake db:create
```

### 4. Run Migrations
